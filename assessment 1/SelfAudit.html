									<p> An Australian TAS teacher has the unique responsibility of fostering young 
										Australians to become confident and creative individuals that are lifelong learners that promotes the 
										desire to be active and informed members of the community now and later in life (Department of Education, 
										Skills and Employment, 2020).</p>
 
										<p>TAS as a subject has the potential to be so much more then learning about textiles or computers, 
										TAS and by extension TAS teachers are in the unique position of being able to reach out and communicate with 
										student on multiple levels while we try and guide students as they work through there identify/ role confusion 
										stage of development (Mcleod, 2018). We can do this by developing there critical thinking skills, by giving them 
										the opportunity to problem solve with hands on activities and filling them with the confidence of a can-do 
										attitude that will hopefully sustain into their lives.</p>
										 
										<p>It is my responsibility as a TAS teacher in training to recognize the potential of students that may 
										really struggle with school. Maybe they struggle with the core subjects? Maybe they only remain in school 
										because they are told they must be present. As a teacher, a human and a formed high school student who 
										struggled I would feel I would be letting students down if I did not provide a safe haven for them in a TAS 
										room just as I found during my high school years.</p>
